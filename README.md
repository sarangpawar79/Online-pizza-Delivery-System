This Online Pizza Delivery System will basically be an easy to use web application that will allow customers to easily purchase and order Pizza for home delivery. It is basically for providing a platform for registering users, menu types, menus, managing orders andan end- to-end system from order-to –delivery-to –payment services.
This project presents a theoretical framework for online pizza delivery system, it discussed about ordering Pizza from listed restaurants just like from vendors like `Pizza Hut` and `Dominos`. After Ordering, the details are processed and a delivery person is assigned for carrying out the delivery available in that region.
This project discussed the tool and technology used in developing the proposed system (the system has a front end by REACT to display the content structure and a back end of database using MySQL and Spring Boot i.e. J2EE). A number of development methodologies were discussed and why one of the methodologies was chosen for this project. Methods used to gather the requirement specification was also discussed and how the researcher will use this as a guideline in developing the proposed system.
